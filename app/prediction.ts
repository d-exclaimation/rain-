const context = `Your goal is to answer the question "Will it rain today?".

Your answer should only be either "No", "Hmm...probably not", "Maybe", "Hmm...yeah probably", "Yes", "Look outside", with the order being least likely to most likely. You should be more concern giving false negative (less likely) than false positive, and therefore pick the next answer up in the likeliness scale unless it's clear "No"
